# Introduction

Some explanation here about the context about food waste, and parts
involved...

# Food waste consumer level

On the consumer level, **individuals in the U.S. throw out nearly 25% of
the food they bring into their homes**. This amounts to a whopping 20
pounds of edible food wasted every single month

```{r food_waste_consumer}

waffle_data <- tibble(
  variable = rep(c("wasted Food", "Not wasted"), times = c(35, 65))
) %>%
  # Converts to waffle data. waffle_iron() can control number of rows and cols.
  waffle_iron(aes_d(group = variable)) %>%
  mutate(label = fontawesome("fa-shopping-basket"))

subtitle_string <- "On the consumer level, individuals in the U.S. throw out nearly 25% of the food they bring into their homes. This amounts to a whopping 20 pounds of edible food wasted every single month"

gg_waste_consumer <- ggplot(waffle_data, aes(x, y, colour = group)) +
  geom_text(aes(label=label), family='fontawesome-webfont', size=8) +
  labs(title= "Food waste per household",

# Food waste equivalences

While at first sight, this might seem neglibile at an individual level,
figures per household and nationwide tell us otherwise: **The costs of
food waste are very high in terms of money and weight**

# Where does the food waste go?

For the U.S. - in 2018 - 

* Municipal solid waste (MSW): 292.4 million tons
  * 1,788 pounds per person or 4.9 pounds per day
* Food waste in MSW: 63.1 million tons (21.6%)
  * 386 pounds per person
  * Management pathway:
    * Composted: 2.6 million tons
    * Incineration, landfill: 42.8 million tons
    * Other management methods: 17.7 million tons


# Landfills

Food waste is the number one material in American landfills, accounting
for 24.1 percent of all municipal solid waste (MSW), [according to the
EPA](https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/food-material-specific-data).

# Emissions

As food rots in a landfill, it emits **_methane_, a greenhouse gas 28 to 36 times more potent than the carbon** that comes out of passenger vehicles and accelerates climate change. The greenhouse gases that result from food waste produce the equivalent amount of 37 million cars

**Landfills are the third-largest industrial emitter of methane**, with food
waste alone representing 8 percent of total global greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions. (Source:
[Rubincon](https://www.rubicon.com/blog/food-waste-facts/)).

In 2007, the global carbon footprint, excluding land-use change, of food waste has been estimated at 3.3 Gtonnes of CO2 eq. This amount is more than twice the total GHG emissions of all USA road transportation in 2010 (Source: [FAO](http://www.fao.org/3/i3347e/i3347e.pdf)).

# Leaks

All landfills leak -- some over time and some from day one of operation
-- leaching toxic chemicals into the ground and the water supply
([source](https://www.clf.org/blog/all-landfills-leak-and-our-health-and-environment-pay-the-toxic-price/))

# Landfills: wrap-up

While it is possible to offset the harm derived from foodwaste in landfills through organics recycling, composting, and anaerobic digestion, **the best way to reduce these emissions and leaks is to waste less food in the first place**.

# Surplus waste distribution

U.S. generates 80.8 million tons of surplus food each year

-   Surplus food is "All food that goes unsold or unused by a business
    or that goes uneaten at home -- including food and inedible parts
    (e.g., peels, pits, bones) that are donated, fed to animals,
    repurposed to produce other products, composted, anaerobically
    digested, or wasted." (ReFED, Insights Engine Glossary, p.1)
-   Includes agricultural waste for produce (fruit, vegetables) but not
    for meat, dairy, fish, etc.

## For Delaware - in 2018 -

-   Municipal solid waste (MSW): 732,614 tons

    -   1,518 pounds per person

-   Food waste estimated in MSW: 154,255 tons (21%)

    -   320 pounds per person

    -   Sources:

        -   Residential sources: 70,455 tons (45.7%)
        -   Industrial, commercial, institutional (ICI): 83,800 tons
            (54.3%)

    -   Combined res + ICI:

        -   Vegetative food wastes, unpackaged: 67,433 tons (43.72%)
        -   Protein food wastes, unpackaged: 24,687 tons (16%)
        -   Food waste in plastic packaging: 51,126 tons (33.14%)
        -   Food waste in other packaging: 11,010 tons (7.14%)

## The cost of food waste

The cost of surplus food is estimated at \$398 billion per year, with
70% of that cost paying for waste management.

If we exclude the surplus food generated on the farm and during
manufacturing, the total surplus food produced by consumers,
foodservice, and retail sectors is 53 million tons per year, or 324.6
pounds per person, and costing \$350 billion. The U.S. EPA set a goal of
reducing food waste disposed by 50% by 2030. Using a 2010 baseline
estimate of 219 pounds per person (post-processing), that means a goal
of disposing 109 pounds per person. The U.S. is far from reaching its
2030 food waste goal.
